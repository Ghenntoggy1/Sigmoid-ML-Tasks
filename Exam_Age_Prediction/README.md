## Getting Started

In order to work with this Jupyter Notebok file, Python 3.13.4 is recommended. To get started, do the following:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**: Create Virtual Environment for Python or use existing:

    ```sh
    python -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate      # On Windows: .\myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Install Requirements**: Install required packages from `requirements.txt` file from the root directory of the repository using next command:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Execute Jupyter Notebook**: Since Jupyter Notebook for the examination is large and contains more than 1500 cells, Github does not render the file:

    1. __IDE__: Use your preferred IDE to execute the Jupyter Notebook.
    2. __Google Colab__: Use the shared link to the Jupyter Notebook hosted on Google Colab [Google Colab - Examination Submission](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11VJdV8vG7fE70czzG9MqRtzkETS0rr-x?usp=sharing). Additional re-run might be required, since JavaScript-based plots - SHAP Force Plots, are not rendered on that page.
