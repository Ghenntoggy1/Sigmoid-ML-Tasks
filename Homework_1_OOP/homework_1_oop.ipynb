    "## Homework #1 - Object-Oriented Programming Principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework I had to implement all my knowledge regarding the OOP principles into practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective: Create a simplified machine learning pipeline that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Specification:\n",
    "* X: A list (or list of lists) representing your features. For simplicity, you can assume\n",
    "one-dimensional features (e.g., [1, 2, 3]), where each number could represent the\n",
    "house size for each different example in your data\n",
    "* y: A list of numeric values representing labels or target values (e.g., [10, 14, 12] for\n",
    "regression - house price, or [0, 1, 0] for classification - pricing category: 0 - not\n",
    "expensive, 1 - expensive)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base Class: MLModel\n",
    "* Define two methods, fit(X, y) and predict(X). Both should raise NotImplementedError by default. This ensures that child classes are responsible for implementing the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Child Classes:\n",
    "* DummyClassifier\n",
    "  * The fit(X, y) method should compute and store the most common target class based on y (store it in self.__mode)\n",
    "  * The predict(X) method should return a list of the same length as X, where each element would be the computed value self.__mode\n",
    "* MeanRegressor:\n",
    "  * In the fit(X, y) method, compute the mean of y and store it (e.g., self.__mean).\n",
    "  * In the predict(X) method, return this stored mean for every input (e.g., \\[self.__mean, self.__mean, ...\\]).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Class:\n",
    "* During object initialization, store the features (X) and targets (y) in private attributes\n",
    "(e.g., __features and __targets).\n",
    "* Provide a method get_data() to return (X, y).\n",
    "* Implement a split(train_fraction=0.8) method that returns (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) by slicing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Demonstration:\n",
    "* Create variables X and y with any values, load them into your Dataset, and split the data into X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test by calling split method\n",
    "* Instantiate each model class, train them on (X_train, y_train) by calling fit method, then predict on X_test.\n",
    "* Print out the predictions for each model.\n",
    "* Highlight Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Inheritance through your implementation and demonstration"
