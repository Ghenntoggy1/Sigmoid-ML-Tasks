    "\n",
    "The next step is to convert the categorical data into binary values (0/1) in order to be able to use them in the model training. At the same time, they will be already in a normalized range of values. For this, I will be using One Hot Encoding, which is a process of converting categorical data into binary values, where each category is represented by a binary value. For example, if we have 3 categories, we will have 3 columns, each representing one category, and the value of the column will be 1 if the category is present in the example, and 0 otherwise. This is a good approach to handle categorical data, since it will not introduce any bias in the model training, and it will not affect the model performance [[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-one-hot-encoding/)]. However, this approach may be applied to data that has not a clear order, like binary values (mainroad, guestroom etc.), where the order of the values does not matter. At the same time, I might use another Encoding method - Ordinal Encoding - a process of converting categorical data into integer values, where the order of the values matters. In my case, I will use this approach for furnishingstatus feature, since it has a clear order of the values (furnished > semi-furnished > not furnished) [[3](https://machinelearningmastery.com/one-hot-encoding-for-categorical-data/)].\n",

I then get the Index object, that contains the names of the columns, and drop the furnishingstatus column from it, since I will use Ordinal Encoding for it. The rest of the columns will be used for One Hot Encoding."
